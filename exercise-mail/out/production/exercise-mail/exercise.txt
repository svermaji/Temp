Usually bodybuilders divide the body up into the following - basic categories: back, shoulders, chest, arms, legs, and waist

There are number of subdivisions necessary in order to create useful bodybuilding routines:
•	Back (upper: latissimus dorsi; lower: spinal erectors)
•	Shoulders (deltoids: front, rear, side; trapezius)
•	Chest (pectorals; rib cage)
•	Arms (biceps; triceps; forearms)
•	Legs (quadriceps; biceps calves)
•	Waist (upper, middle, and lower abdominals obliques)

Actually I prefer to treat forearms and calves as separate body parts, since they respond best to intensive and specialized treatment. So I also include the following subdivisions: forearms (inside;
outside) and calves (gastrocnemiusj soleus).

For the Basic Training Program, I recommend the following split:
Level I: each body part 2 times a week
Level II: each body part 3 times a week
Abdominals: 6 times a week both levels
